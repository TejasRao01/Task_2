# Mini Task - 2, Existing Market solutions

This project uses a display that is mounted on a cap and uses a raspeberry pi as the microcontroller. The display is a monocular head-mounted display setup that uses an lcd (although other displays can be used). The lcd display is then magnified by means of a lens to make it easier to see the screen. The advantage of this project is its simplicity, there is no complex circuitry that requires specialist knowledge. However, the main disadvantages of this is that the display is not transparent, which is requried for our project, and that the usage of raspberry pi is impractical due to its higher cost. The project is very feasible as all components can be easily procured and purchased from the market. The budget for this project would be similar to what we are looking for, excepto for the fact that it makes use of a raspberry pi.

This project is similar to what we are trying to make. The project uses an intel-edison with arduino-ide is used as the microcontroller and a uses an led display that projects the information with the help of mirrors. For transmitting and recieving data, it uses an HC-05 bluetooth module. Since the intel edison performs the function of hardware interfacing, there is no need for a customised pcb. The project also has an android app and cloud-storage functionality for data visualization. The advantage of this project is that it is similar to our project plan and can be used as a template for the design. Furthermore, it uses components that are easy to procure and customise. The disadvantage of this is that it uses an Intel-edison which is no longer available and was expensive.

This project uses a raspberry pi as the microcontroller and incorporates several different types of sensors to make a very smart hud mounted helmet. The writer plans to dedicate 3 raspberry pis, one each display that is planned. The displays are 7 inch lcds. The project also uses several different types of sensors that are used to ensure seameless vr display. In addition to these, the project uses several servo motors to control the vizors and airvents. The advantages of this project is that it is a highly sophisticated version of what we are trying to achieve, however, that is also a disadvantage as the cost having 3 raspberry pis is very high and incorporating so many sensors and motors will not only cause the costs to balloon, but will also make implenetation very difficult.

This is an existing market product that uses an oled display to display maps while being transparent so as to not hinder the vision of the rider trying to see the road. The system uses an externally mounted bluetooth unit to link to the user's phone. The module also has a microphone and speakers that can be used to issue voice commands or communicate with other riders. The

This project is not strictly related to our project, but it does provide some useful ideas for implementing our project. The project basically creates a helmet that uses a camera to project the surroundings onto a screen inside the helmet. The
