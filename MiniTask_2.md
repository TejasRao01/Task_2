# Mini Task - 2, Existing Market solutions 


1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sqBGGc_kWw
  
This project uses a display that is mounted on a cap and uses a raspeberry pi as the microcontroller. The display is a monocular head-mounted display setup that uses an lcd (although other displays can be used). The lcd display is then magnified by means of a lens to make it easier to see the screen. The advantage of this project is its simplicity, there is no complex circuitry that requires specialist knowledge. However, the main disadvantages of this is that the display is not transparent, which is requried for our project, and that the usage of raspberry pi is impractical due to its higher cost. The project is very feasible as all components can be easily procured and purchased from the market. The budget for this project would be similar to what we are looking for, excepto for the fact that it makes use of a raspberry pi.

This project is similar to what we are trying to make. The project uses an intel-edison with arduino-ide is used as the microcontroller and a uses an led display that projects the information with the help of mirrors. For transmitting and recieving data, it uses an HC-05 bluetooth module. Since the intel edison performs the function of hardware interfacing, there is no need for a customised pcb. The project also has an android app and cloud-storage functionality for data visualization. The advantage of this project is that it is similar to our project plan and can be used as a template for the design. Furthermore, it uses components that are easy to procure and customise. The disadvantage of this is that it uses an Intel-edison which is no longer available and was expensive.

This project uses a raspberry pi as the microcontroller and incorporates several different types of sensors to make a very smart hud mounted helmet. The writer plans to dedicate 3 raspberry pis, one each display that is planned. The displays are 7 inch lcds. The project also uses several different types of sensors that are used to ensure seameless vr display. In addition to these, the project uses several servo motors to control the vizors and airvents. The advantages of this project is that it is a highly sophisticated version of what we are trying to achieve, however, that is also a disadvantage as the cost having 3 raspberry pis is very high and incorporating so many sensors and motors will not only cause the costs to balloon, but will also make implenetation very difficult.

This is an existing market product that uses an oled display to display maps while being transparent so as to not hinder the vision of the rider trying to see the road. The system uses an externally mounted bluetooth unit to link to the user's phone. The module also has a microphone and speakers that can be used to issue voice commands or communicate with other riders. The

This project is not strictly related to our project, but it does provide some useful ideas for implementing our project. The project basically creates a helmet that uses a camera to project the surroundings onto a screen inside the helmet. The key takeaway from this is the controller s

This is one of the solutions that is available on the market. The design makes use of a transparent LED to display the map. One of the key features that it has, that might be overlooked in our implementation is a light sensor that is used to provide feedback to adjust the brightness of the hud display. The phone is the main computer and the microcontroller is only there to control the display after processing and converting the instructions issued from the phone. As mentioned earlier, the major disadvantage of such a mechanismm is that it does not dispaly the images at infinity and that can be disorienting and distracting to the rider. Since this product is still under development, its price isnt available.  The key takeway from this is proof of concept and its design.

7. https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-27-nuviz-headsup-display.html

This design is an example of an internally mounted display setup. The difference of this product over what we are trying to make is that it does not take up the entire line of sight. Rather,the display is at the bottom of the line of sight of the rider and project all the required information. The setup also includes audio that integrates with the visual display to provide navigational instructions. The advantage of this product is that not using a mirror system reduces that complexity, weight, and increases the versatily of the helmet. The disadvantage of this design is its price which is $700. Another disadvantage is that the display will not be clearly visible if the visor is dirty, which is a problem in the dusty cities.

This design also uses a transparent non oled display to project the images. While this creates an issue of the image not being formed at infinity, that fact that several products use such a setup suggests that this display design should not be overlooked. The other disadvantage of this products is its cost which is upwards of 500 euros.


9.  https://helmeeet.blogspot.com/2020/01/hud-projector-helmet.html

This describes a the Nuviz hud technology, by giving a glimpse into the hud display with a exploded image. The design uses a LCOS microdisplay engine for projecting the image and has all the sensors and microcontroller integrated into a compact package. The advantage of this design is that it is compact. However, it carries with it the disadvantage that it is expensive and that the display is external to the helmet, which makes it less visible compared to a internal display. The key takeawy from this design is the display screen and mechanism.

This is another currently existing product that is available on the market. unlike the previous example, the advantage of this product is that the display is internally mounted and thus avoids the disadvanteges that are present in an externally mounted display. The product also allows the image to be formed at infinity which is less distracting while riding. The only disadvantage is that the site does not give the exact detail of the sensors and projectors that are used for the design. The key takeaway for the design is the proof of concept that an internally mounted display is feasible.

This is same as 9. and is a review on the Nuviz hud display. It also lists the advantages of the product. The main disadvantage of this desgins is the cost which is almost $700. This can serve as a benchmark price that we have to beat for our design. 


12. https://www.rideapart.com/reviews/252623/new-jarvish-smart-helmets-with-hud-and-camera/

This is not a mountable HUD display, rather it is a smart helmet with all capabilities built into it. The helmmet features a retractable HUD display and miccrophones and speaker.  The HUD displays such information as speed traveled, speed limit for the area, time, weather, and GPS instructions, as well as caller information. The only issue with design is the price which is $1699 when it hits the market. This is more expensive than most two wheelers available in the indian market.

 CARDO â€“ Motorcycle Helmet Head Up Display:
 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MYB95SX?tag=justhelmet-20&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1
  
  
  This product is similar to what we are trying to create. An interesting feature that this feature of this product is a mounted 8MP camera to take photos and videos. The product syncs to the phone via bluetooth and provides the exact kind of functionality that we desire to incorporate into our product. The cost of the product is $425, which is a price that we should actually keep as our benchmark. The helmet is also fully compatible with all helmet designs, requiring an additional mount for compaible with open helmets. The product also includes jbl speakers for audio and a microphone ( which is extra). The main disadvantages ( on reading the reviews) are with the microphone with will not pickup the audio commands perfectly, and bugs with the software. A careful review of the software has to be done inorder to ensure that the experience is glitch free.
