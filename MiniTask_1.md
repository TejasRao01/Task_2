# Mounted HUD - Project Pipeline and Ideation

## Project statement:

This project aims to create a helmet mounted HUD system to assist the bike riders navigate the roads by projecting the city map onto the screen. 


## Pipeline:
1. The first stage of this project involves identifying the components needed for the project.
2. The next stage of the project is to analyse each of these components, their pros and cons, and decide which components can be worked on and improved. 
3. The next stage is the ideation phase, in which reasearch is done on the previously identified components to improve their performance. During this phase, extensive market research is also performed and pre-existing solutions are also reviewed and ideas are borrowed from them. 
4. After this, the components are finalised and ordered, the design plans made, and the code to control the various components is written. 
5. Now the prototOype can be built, assembled and debugged.
6. Finally, the project can be taken further for more R&D.

### Analysing each phase:
#### 1. Components identification:
The components used for this project are:
1. Microcontroller
2. PCB
3. HUD display
4. Bluetooth connection transmitter/reciver
